# three different categories I am using for my research questions are the following:
# 1. Methods that never had SATD (so always 0)
# 2. Methods that had SATD (1) and ended with SATD (1)
# 3. Methods that had SATD (1) and ended without SATD (0)

# Write a python script that takes in a folder of csv files and makes a cdf 
# (save it to somewhere instead of showing since I am working on ubuntu) 
# of various code metric distributions between the three above categories. 
# 
# Use the following columns for each cdf, SLOCStandard
# Readability
# SimpleReadability
# MaintainabilityIndex
# McCabe
# totalFanOut
# uniqueFanOut

# Use one for loop (like don't iterate through the whole csv file to get the categories THEN again iterate through the categores (O(2n)))
